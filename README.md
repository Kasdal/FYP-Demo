# FYP-Demo
This project will be used as a demo of my overall project, which includes the use of Ansible for configuration automation. The demo will showcase the different components of the project, as well as the end-to-end functionality of the project, including the use of ansible to automate the configuration and deployment of resources, tools, and servers.
